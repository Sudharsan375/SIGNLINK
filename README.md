The Tamil-speaking deaf and hearing-impaired faces communication barriers due to the lack of accurate translation tools. our project translates spoken Tamil into (ISL) in real-time utilizing cutting-edge NLP algorithms. The program makes communication more efficient by using 3D animations to represent ISL motions and an easy-to-use user interface.
